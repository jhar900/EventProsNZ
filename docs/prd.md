# Event Pros NZ Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Create New Zealand's premier event professional directory platform
- Connect event organizers with trusted, vetted event service providers
- Streamline the event planning process through centralized discovery and booking
- Establish a sustainable revenue model through tiered vendor subscriptions
- Launch MVP within 2 months with 100+ vendors and 500+ event organizers
- Achieve 80% vendor booking success rate within 6 months

### Background Context

Event organizers across New Zealand currently struggle to find reliable, vetted event professionals in their area, while event contractors lack a centralized platform to showcase their services and connect with potential clients. The current market is fragmented with solutions that lack trust features and don't provide a comprehensive view of available services. Event Pros NZ addresses this gap by creating a centralized marketplace that combines discovery, evaluation, and booking capabilities with built-in trust and safety features, specifically designed for the New Zealand market.
