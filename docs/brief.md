## Problem Statement

The New Zealand event industry suffers from significant fragmentation and inefficiency, creating substantial pain points for both event managers and service providers. Currently, event managers must navigate multiple platforms, directories, and personal networks to find qualified contractors, resulting in time-consuming research, inconsistent quality, and missed opportunities.

**Current State Pain Points:**

**For Event Managers:**

- **Discovery Friction:** No centralized platform to find contractors by service type, location, and budget
- **Quality Uncertainty:** Difficulty verifying contractor credentials, experience, and reliability
- **Planning Complexity:** Lack of guidance on what services are needed, when to book them, and realistic budgets
- **Communication Inefficiency:** Scattered communication across multiple channels and platforms
- **Time Investment:** Hours spent researching, contacting, and coordinating with multiple contractors

**For Event Contractors:**

- **Visibility Challenges:** Limited opportunities to showcase services to potential clients
- **Client Acquisition Costs:** High time and effort required to find and convert new clients
- **Inconsistent Lead Quality:** Receiving inquiries that don't match their services or availability
- **Business Management Overhead:** Lack of tools to manage client relationships and track business metrics
- **Market Fragmentation:** Difficulty understanding market demand and competitive landscape

**Impact of the Problem:**

- **Lost Revenue:** Contractors miss opportunities due to poor visibility
- **Increased Costs:** Event managers pay premium prices due to limited market access
- **Poor Experiences:** Mismatched expectations and communication breakdowns
- **Industry Inefficiency:** Duplicate effort and missed connections across the market

**Why Existing Solutions Fall Short:**

- **Generic Job Boards:** Don't understand event industry nuances or provide planning guidance
- **Social Media:** Unreliable for business transactions and lacks structured information
- **Personal Networks:** Limited reach and inconsistent quality
- **Industry Associations:** Focus on networking rather than transactional connections

**Urgency and Importance:**
The event industry is recovering post-COVID with increased demand for professional services, making this the optimal time to introduce a comprehensive solution that addresses these long-standing inefficiencies.
