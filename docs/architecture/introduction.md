# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for Event Pros NZ, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

### Starter Template or Existing Project

Based on my review of the PRD and front-end spec, this is a **greenfield project** with no existing starter template mentioned. The PRD specifies:

- **Next.js 14** with App Router for frontend
- **Supabase** for backend services (database, auth, storage)
- **Vercel** for deployment
- **TypeScript** throughout

**N/A - Greenfield project**
