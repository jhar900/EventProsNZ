### Previous Story Insights

This is the first story in the project, so no previous story context exists.

### Technology Stack

[Source: architecture/system-overview.md#technology-stack]

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Authentication, Real-time subscriptions)
- **External Services**: Stripe (payments), Mapbox GL JS (mapping)
- **Deployment**: Vercel with zero-config deployment
- **Testing**: Jest and React Testing Library

### Architecture Context

[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#frontend-layer]

- **Next.js 14 Application**: Full-stack React application with TypeScript
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for responsive design
- **Component Library**: Reusable UI components with design system
- **State Management**: React Context and hooks for state management
- **Routing**: Next.js App Router for client-side navigation

### External Service Integrations

[Source: architecture/external-service-integrations.md]

**Stripe Configuration:**

- Currency: NZD (New Zealand Dollar)
- Tax Rate: 15% (NZ GST)
- Subscription tiers: Essential (Free), Showcase ($29/month), Spotlight ($99/month)

**Mapbox Configuration:**

- Default center: Wellington, NZ coordinates [174.7762, -41.2865]
- Default zoom: 6
- Country filter: New Zealand only

**Supabase Configuration:**

- PostgreSQL database with built-in authentication
- Real-time subscriptions for live updates
- File storage with CDN integration
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies

### Environment Variables Required

[Source: architecture/deployment-infrastructure.md#environment-variables]

**Development Environment:**

- NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL: "http://localhost:3000"
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL: Supabase project URL
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY: Supabase anonymous key
- STRIPE_SECRET_KEY: Stripe test secret key
- NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY: Stripe test publishable key
- NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN: Mapbox access token

### Project Structure Notes

No specific project structure guidance found in architecture docs. The story should follow standard Next.js 14 App Router conventions:

- `app/` directory for pages and layouts
- `components/` directory for reusable components
- `lib/` directory for utilities and configurations
- `types/` directory for TypeScript type definitions
- `public/` directory for static assets

### Testing Standards

[Source: architecture/system-overview.md#technology-stack]

- **Testing Framework**: Jest and React Testing Library
- **Test Location**: Co-located with components or in `__tests__` directories
- **Testing Patterns**: Component testing, integration testing, unit testing
- **Coverage Requirements**: Aim for comprehensive test coverage of critical functionality

### File Locations

Based on Next.js 14 App Router conventions:

- Main configuration: `next.config.js`, `tailwind.config.js`, `tsconfig.json`
- Environment files: `.env.local`, `.env.example`
- Package configuration: `package.json`
- Git configuration: `.gitignore`
- Documentation: `README.md`

### Technical Constraints

[Source: architecture/deployment-infrastructure.md#performance-optimization]

- Image optimization with WebP and AVIF formats
- Code splitting and lazy loading
- Bundle optimization
- Performance targets: < 3 seconds page load time on 3G
