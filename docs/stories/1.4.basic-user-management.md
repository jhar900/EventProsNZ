## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

This story builds on:

- **Story 1.1**: Project setup with Next.js and Supabase integration
- **Story 1.2**: Database schema with user tables and role management
- **Story 1.3**: Authentication system with role-based access

The user management system will use the existing database schema and authentication system to provide admin functionality for managing platform users.

### Data Models

[Source: architecture/data-models.md#user]
The user management system will work with the following data models:

**User Table:**

- `id` UUID (references auth.users)
- `email` TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL
- `role` user_role ENUM ('event_manager', 'contractor', 'admin')
- `is_verified` BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
- `last_login` TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
- `created_at` TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
- `updated_at` TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()

**Profile Table:**

- `user_id` UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
- `first_name` TEXT NOT NULL
- `last_name` TEXT NOT NULL
- `phone` TEXT
- `address` TEXT
- `profile_photo_url` TEXT
- `bio` TEXT
- `preferences` JSON

**Activity Log Table (to be created):**

- `id` UUID PRIMARY KEY
- `user_id` UUID REFERENCES users(id)
- `action` TEXT NOT NULL
- `details` JSON
- `ip_address` INET
- `user_agent` TEXT
- `created_at` TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()

### API Specifications

// Example admin service
class AdminService {
  async getUsers(filters: UserFilters): Promise<UserListResponse>;
  async getUserDetails(userId: string): Promise<UserDetails>;
  async updateUserRole(userId: string, role: UserRole): Promise<User>;
  async verifyUser(userId: string): Promise<void>;
  async suspendUser(userId: string, reason: string): Promise<void>;
  async getUserActivity(userId: string): Promise<ActivityLog[]>;
  async logAdminAction(action: AdminAction): Promise<void>;
}
```

### State Management

[Source: architecture/components.md#state-management-architecture]
**Zustand Store:**

```typescript
interface AdminStore {
  users: User[];
  selectedUser: User | null;
  filters: UserFilters;
  isLoading: boolean;
  fetchUsers: (filters?: UserFilters) => Promise<void>;
  updateUserRole: (userId: string, role: UserRole) => Promise<void>;
  verifyUser: (userId: string) => Promise<void>;
  suspendUser: (userId: string, reason: string) => Promise<void>;
  searchUsers: (query: string) => void;
  clearFilters: () => void;
}
```
