## Dev Notes

### Data Models

- **FeatureRequest**: Extended with admin management fields including priority, effort_estimate, assigned_to, roadmap_status
- **FeatureRequestPriority**: Priority management with request_id, priority_score, impact_score, effort_score, calculated_at
- **CommunityAnnouncement**: Community communication with id, title, content, target_audience, created_at, expires_at
- **RoadmapMilestone**: Roadmap planning with id, title, description, target_date, status, feature_request_ids
- **FeatureRequestAnalytics**: Analytics data with request_id, views, votes, comments, status_changes, engagement_score

### API Endpoints

- **GET /admin/feature-requests**: Get feature requests for admin management with filtering
