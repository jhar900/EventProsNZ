- Robust MFA implementation with TOTP, SMS, and backup codes
- Excellent API design with proper authentication and authorization
- Extensive audit logging and monitoring capabilities
- Proper error handling and validation throughout
- Complete React component implementations for all access control features
- Comprehensive test coverage for core services and API endpoints

**Areas of Concern:**

- Some integration tests could be more comprehensive for end-to-end flows
- Identity management integration (SSO) not yet implemented
- Some API endpoints could benefit from additional error scenario testing
