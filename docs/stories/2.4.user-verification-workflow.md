### Previous Story Insights

This story builds on:

- **Story 1.1**: Project setup with Next.js and Supabase integration
- **Story 1.2**: Database schema with user tables and role management
- **Story 1.3**: Authentication system with role-based access
- **Story 1.4**: Basic user management with admin functionality

    filters: VerificationFilters
  ): Promise<VerificationItem[]>;
  async approveUser(userId: string, reason?: string): Promise<VerificationLog>;
  async rejectUser(
    userId: string,
    reason: string,
    feedback?: string
  ): Promise<VerificationLog>;
  async resubmitUser(userId: string): Promise<VerificationLog>;
  async getVerificationAnalytics(period: string): Promise<VerificationMetrics>;
  async sendNotification(notification: Notification): Promise<void>;
}
```

### State Management

```typescript
interface VerificationStore {
  verificationQueue: VerificationItem[];
  currentVerification: VerificationItem | null;
  verificationMetrics: VerificationMetrics;
  notifications: Notification[];
  isLoading: boolean;
  fetchVerificationQueue: (filters?: VerificationFilters) => Promise<void>;
  approveUser: (userId: string, reason?: string) => Promise<void>;
  rejectUser: (
    userId: string,
    reason: string,
    feedback?: string
  ) => Promise<void>;
  resubmitUser: (userId: string) => Promise<void>;
