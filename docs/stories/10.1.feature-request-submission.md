## Dev Notes

### Data Models

- **FeatureRequest**: Core feature request entity with user_id, title, description, category, tags, status, votes, created_at, updated_at
- **FeatureRequestVote**: Voting data with feature_request_id, user_id, vote_type, created_at
- **FeatureRequestCategory**: Category management with id, name, description, color
- **FeatureRequestTag**: Tag management with id, name, usage_count
- **FeatureRequestStatus**: Status tracking with feature_request_id, status, changed_by, changed_at, comments

### API Endpoints

- **POST /feature-requests**: Submit feature request with validation
- **GET /feature-requests**: Get feature requests with filtering and search
- **PUT /feature-requests/{id}**: Update feature request (owner only)
- **DELETE /feature-requests/{id}**: Delete feature request (owner only)
- **POST /feature-requests/{id}/vote**: Vote on feature request
- **GET /feature-requests/{id}/votes**: Get voting data for feature request
- **GET /feature-requests/categories**: Get available categories
- **GET /feature-requests/tags**: Get popular tags

### Components Architecture

- **FeatureRequestForm**: Feature request submission form
- **FeatureRequestCard**: Individual feature request display
- **FeatureRequestVoting**: Voting system component
- **FeatureRequestSearch**: Search and filtering interface
- **FeatureRequestStatus**: Status tracking component
- **CategorySelector**: Category selection component
- **TagInput**: Tag input and management component

### Integration Points
