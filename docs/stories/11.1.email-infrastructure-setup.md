2. **Email Queue Manager Tests** - FIXED ✅
   - Fixed Supabase mock structure to properly handle complex query chains (`select().eq().lte().order().limit()`)
   - Updated mock setup to return proper query objects for each `from()` call
   - Fixed SendGridService mocking to properly inject mock into EmailQueueManager constructor
   - Corrected parameter order bug in `updateQueueItemStatus` when marking emails as failed

   - All tests remain passing (10/10)

**Key Technical Fixes:**

1. **Supabase Mock Configuration**:
   - Created comprehensive mock query objects supporting all Supabase methods
   - Implemented proper method chaining for complex queries
   - Fixed mock implementation to handle different table types (users, email_templates)

2. **Template Manager Mocking**:
   - Removed module-level mocking to allow real class usage
   - Implemented proper method mocking for getTemplate, validateTemplateVariables, renderTemplate
   - Fixed template validation logic to match API route expectations
