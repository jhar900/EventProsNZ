## Dev Notes

### Data Models

- **Job**: Extended with job_type field ('event_manager' | 'contractor_internal') and internal job specific fields
- **InternalJobDetails**: Additional fields for internal jobs including job_type_category, skill_requirements, experience_level, payment_terms, work_arrangement
- **JobApplication**: Application system for internal jobs with same structure as external jobs
- **User**: Contractor relationship for internal job posting permissions
- **BusinessProfile**: Integration for contractor business information and verification

### API Endpoints

- **POST /jobs/internal**: Create internal job posting with validation
- **PUT /jobs/internal/{jobId}**: Update internal job (owner only)
- **DELETE /jobs/internal/{jobId}**: Delete internal job (owner only)
- **GET /jobs/internal**: List internal jobs with filtering by job type, skills, experience
- **GET /jobs/internal/{jobId}**: Get internal job details
- **POST /jobs/internal/{jobId}/applications**: Apply to internal job
- **GET /jobs/internal/{jobId}/applications**: Get applications for internal job

### Components Architecture

- **InternalJobForm**: Form component for creating internal job postings
- **InternalJobCard**: Display component for internal job listings
- **JobTypeSelector**: Component for selecting job type categories
- **SkillRequirements**: Component for specifying skill requirements
- **PaymentTerms**: Component for payment and work arrangement details
- **InternalJobFilters**: Filtering component for internal job search
- **InternalJobManagement**: Dashboard for managing internal jobs

### Integration Points

- **Business Profile System**: Contractor business information and verification
- **Notification System**: Job alerts and candidate notifications
- **Application System**: Shared application management with external jobs
- **Search System**: Enhanced filtering for internal job discovery
- **Analytics**: Internal job performance tracking

### Security Considerations

- Internal job posting ownership validation
- Contractor business profile verification
- Content moderation for internal job postings
- Application privacy and data protection
- Rate limiting for job posting creation

### Performance Requirements

- Efficient internal job search with advanced filtering
- Optimized queries for job type and skill matching
- Caching for frequently accessed internal job data
- Lazy loading for job listings and applications
- Background processing for job matching notifications

### Business Rules

- **Job Type Categories**: Casual work, subcontracting, partnerships
- **Contractor Verification**: Only verified contractors can post internal jobs
- **Business Profile Integration**: Internal jobs linked to contractor business profiles
- **Visual Differentiation**: Clear distinction from event manager jobs
- **Application Management**: Same application system as external jobs

### Visual Design Requirements

- **Job Type Icons**: Distinct icons for each job type category
- **Color Coding**: Consistent color scheme for internal jobs
- **Visual Badges**: Clear indicators for internal vs external jobs
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly internal job interfaces
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for all internal job components

### Testing

- **Test file location**: `__tests__/components/features/jobs/internal/`
- **Test standards**: Jest + React Testing Library + Supertest for API
- **Testing frameworks**: Unit tests for components, integration tests for API endpoints
- **Specific requirements**: Test job type categorization, visual differentiation, application management, and contractor verification
