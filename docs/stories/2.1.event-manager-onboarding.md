4. Step 4: Optional event creation to get started immediately
5. Profile completion with business information
6. Verification workflow for account approval
7. Dashboard access with role-specific features

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

This story builds on:

- **Story 1.1**: Project setup with Next.js and Supabase integration
- **Story 1.2**: Database schema with user tables and role management
- **Story 1.3**: Authentication system with role-based access
- **Story 1.4**: Basic user management with admin functionality
- **Story 1.5**: Basic UI framework and navigation

The event manager onboarding will use the existing authentication system and database schema to create comprehensive user profiles with business information.

### Data Models

[Source: architecture/data-models.md#user]
The onboarding system will work with the following data models:

**User Table:**

- `id` UUID (references auth.users)
- `email` TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL
- `role` user_role ENUM ('event_manager', 'contractor', 'admin')
- `is_verified` BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
- `last_login` TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
- `created_at` TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
- `updated_at` TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()

**Profile Table:**

- `user_id` UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
- `first_name` TEXT NOT NULL
- `last_name` TEXT NOT NULL
- `phone` TEXT
- `address` TEXT
- `profile_photo_url` TEXT
- `bio` TEXT
- `preferences` JSON

**BusinessProfile Table (optional for event managers):**

- `user_id` UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
- `company_name` TEXT NOT NULL
- `business_address` TEXT
- `nzbn` TEXT
- `description` TEXT
- `service_areas` TEXT[]
- `social_links` JSON
- `is_verified` BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
- `verification_date` TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE

### API Specifications

### Mapbox Integration

[Source: architecture/maps/mapbox-config.ts]
**Mapbox Features:**

- Address autocomplete for personal and business addresses
- Location search and selection
- Address validation and formatting
- Geocoding and reverse geocoding
- Service area mapping for business profiles

**Implementation:**

```typescript
// Example Mapbox integration
interface AddressAutocompleteProps {
  value: string;
  onChange: (address: string) => void;
  placeholder?: string;
  validation?: ValidationSchema;
}
```

### Testing

[Source: architecture/testing.md#testing-strategy]
**Testing Standards:**

- **Component Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library for onboarding components
- **API Testing**: Jest + Supertest for onboarding endpoints
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright for complete onboarding flows
- **File Upload Testing**: Test profile photo upload and validation
- **Test File Location**: `__tests__/onboarding/` directory
- **Test Scenarios**: Step-by-step onboarding, form validation, file uploads, address autocomplete
- **Coverage Requirements**: 80% coverage for onboarding logic and components

### Onboarding Flow

**Step-by-Step Process:**

1. **Personal Information**: Name, email, phone, address with Mapbox autocomplete
2. **Role Selection**: Personal events vs business event management
3. **Business Details**: Company information (if business role selected)
4. **Profile Photo**: Optional photo upload and management
5. **Verification**: Automatic approval for event managers
6. **Tutorial**: Platform introduction and getting started guide
7. **Dashboard Access**: Role-specific dashboard with features

**Business Logic:**

- Event managers get automatic approval after profile completion
- Business information is optional for personal event managers
- Address validation using Mapbox geocoding
- Profile completion tracking with progress indicators
- File upload with image optimization and validation

### State Management

[Source: architecture/components.md#state-management-architecture]
**Onboarding State Management:**

```typescript
interface OnboardingStore {
  currentStep: number;
  totalSteps: number;
  profileData: Partial<Profile>;
  businessProfileData: Partial<BusinessProfile>;
  isCompleted: boolean;
  setCurrentStep: (step: number) => void;
  updateProfileData: (data: Partial<Profile>) => void;
  updateBusinessProfileData: (data: Partial<BusinessProfile>) => void;
  completeOnboarding: () => Promise<void>;
  resetOnboarding: () => void;
}
```
