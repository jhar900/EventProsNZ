# Story 3.2: Advanced Search & Filtering

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As an** event manager,  
**I want** to search and filter contractors by specific criteria,  
**so that** I can find the most relevant service providers for my needs.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Text search across contractor names, services, and descriptions
2. Service type filtering with multiple selection
3. Location-based filtering with radius options
4. Region selection (tick boxes) with multiple selection
5. Budget range filtering with price indicators
6. Average Rating filtering options
7. Response time filtering ("Responds within 24 hours" vs "Responds within 48 hours")
8. Portfolio size filtering ("Has portfolio" vs "No portfolio")
9. Search result sorting (relevance, rating, price, distance)
10. Search history, saved searches and favourites functionality
11. Real-time search as users type
12. Search debouncing (wait 300ms after user stops typing)

- **Performance Testing**: Test search performance and debouncing
- **Test File Location**: `__tests__/search/` directory
- **Test Scenarios**: Search functionality, filtering, sorting, history, favorites
- **Coverage Requirements**: 80% coverage for search logic and components

### Performance Considerations

**Search Optimization:**

- Database indexing for search fields
- Search result caching
- Query optimization and pagination
- Debounced search input
- Lazy loading for search results

**Filter Performance:**

- Efficient filter combination logic
- Filter state management
- Real-time filter updates
- Filter result caching
- Optimized filter queries

### State Management

[Source: architecture/components.md#state-management-architecture]
**Search State Management:**

```typescript
interface SearchStore {
  searchQuery: string;
  filters: SearchFilters;
  sortBy: SortOption;
  results: Contractor[];
  totalResults: number;
  isLoading: boolean;
  searchHistory: SearchHistory[];
  savedSearches: SavedSearch[];
  favorites: ContractorFavorite[];
  performSearch: (query: string, filters?: SearchFilters) => Promise<void>;
  updateFilters: (filters: Partial<SearchFilters>) => void;
  setSortBy: (sortBy: SortOption) => void;
  saveSearch: (
    name: string,
    query: string,
    filters: SearchFilters
  ) => Promise<void>;
  addToFavorites: (contractorId: string) => Promise<void>;
  removeFromFavorites: (contractorId: string) => Promise<void>;
}
```
