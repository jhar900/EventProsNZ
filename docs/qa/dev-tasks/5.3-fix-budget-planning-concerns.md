# Dev Task: Fix Budget Planning Test Failures & Performance Concerns

## Overview

**Story**: 5.3 - Budget Planning & Recommendations  
**QA Gate**: CONCERNS  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Assigned**: Dev Agent  
**Created**: 2025-01-12  
**Due**: Before production deployment

## Background

The Budget Planning & Recommendations story has been marked as CONCERNS due to test failures and performance issues that need to be addressed before production deployment. The implementation is functionally complete with comprehensive business logic, but requires fixes to ensure reliability and performance.

## Issues to Address

### 1. Test Failures (HIGH Priority)

**Problem**: 5 out of 81 tests are failing due to API route mock setup issues

**Files Affected**:

- `__tests__/budget/budget-api.test.ts`

**Specific Issues**:

- API route tests failing with 400 errors due to mock setup problems
- NextRequest mock structure not properly configured
- Mock data not being returned correctly from service mocks

**Expected Behavior**:

- All API route tests should pass with 200 status codes
- Mock services should return proper data structures
- Test coverage should remain at 93.8% or higher

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] All 81 budget tests pass
- [ ] API route tests return proper mock data
- [ ] No console errors during test execution
- [ ] Test coverage maintained or improved

### 2. Performance Concerns (MEDIUM Priority)

**Problem**: No caching implemented for budget calculations

**Files Affected**:

- `lib/budget/budget-service.ts`
- `lib/budget/pricing-service.ts`

**Specific Issues**:

- Budget calculations run on every request without caching
- Pricing data fetched from database repeatedly
- No performance optimization for large datasets

**Expected Behavior**:

- Budget calculations should be cached for repeated requests
- Pricing data should be cached with appropriate TTL
- Performance should be optimized for large datasets

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] Budget calculation caching implemented
- [ ] Pricing data caching with appropriate TTL
- [ ] Cache invalidation strategy defined
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet requirements

## Technical Requirements

### Test Fixes

1. **Fix API Route Mock Setup**:

   ```typescript
   // Ensure proper NextRequest mock structure
   const request = new global.NextRequest(
     'http://localhost:3000/api/budget/breakdown?event_id=123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000'
   );

   // Mock service responses should match expected data structure
   mockBudgetService.getServiceBreakdown.mockResolvedValue({
     breakdown: [...],
     total: 5000
   });
   ```

2. **Fix Mock Data Structure**:
   - Ensure all mock data uses valid UUIDs
   - Mock responses should match API route expectations
   - Service mocks should return proper data types

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Implement Caching Strategy**:

   ```typescript
   // BudgetService caching
   private cache = new Map<string, { data: any; timestamp: number }>();
   private cacheTTL = 5 * 60 * 1000; // 5 minutes

   // Check cache before expensive operations
   const cached = this.cache.get(cacheKey);
   if (cached && Date.now() - cached.timestamp < this.cacheTTL) {
     return cached.data;
   }
   ```

2. **Add Cache Management**:
   - Implement cache clearing methods
   - Add cache statistics and monitoring
   - Define cache invalidation strategies

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Fix Test Failures

1. **Analyze failing tests**:

   ```bash
   npm test -- __tests__/budget/budget-api.test.ts --verbose
   ```

2. **Fix mock setup issues**:
   - Update NextRequest mock structure
   - Fix service mock return values
   - Ensure proper UUID validation

3. **Verify test fixes**:
   ```bash
   npm test -- __tests__/budget/ --coverage
   ```

### Phase 2: Implement Performance Optimizations

1. **Add caching to BudgetService**:
   - Implement cache for budget calculations
   - Add cache TTL and invalidation
   - Add cache statistics

2. **Add caching to PricingService**:
   - Implement cache for pricing data
   - Add cache TTL and invalidation
   - Optimize database queries

3. **Performance testing**:
   - Add performance benchmarks
   - Test with large datasets
   - Monitor cache hit rates

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests

- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] New tests for caching functionality
- [ ] Performance tests for large datasets

### Integration Tests

- [ ] API route integration tests
- [ ] Database operation tests
- [ ] Cache functionality tests

### Performance Tests

- [ ] Budget calculation performance
- [ ] Pricing data retrieval performance
- [ ] Cache hit rate monitoring

## Success Criteria

### Test Fixes

- ✅ All 81 budget tests pass
- ✅ Test coverage maintained at 93.8% or higher
- ✅ No console errors during test execution
- ✅ API route tests return proper responses

### Performance Improvements

- ✅ Budget calculations cached with 5-minute TTL
- ✅ Pricing data cached with 10-minute TTL
- ✅ Cache hit rate > 80% for repeated requests
- ✅ Performance improved by > 50% for large datasets

## Files to Modify

### Test Files

- `__tests__/budget/budget-api.test.ts` - Fix mock setup issues
- `__tests__/budget/budget-service.test.ts` - Add caching tests
- `__tests__/budget/pricing-service.test.ts` - Add caching tests

### Service Files

- `lib/budget/budget-service.ts` - Add caching implementation
- `lib/budget/pricing-service.ts` - Add caching implementation

### API Routes
