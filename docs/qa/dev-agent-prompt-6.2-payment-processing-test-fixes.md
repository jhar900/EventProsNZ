# Dev Agent Prompt: Payment Processing Test Infrastructure Fixes

## üö® **CRITICAL ISSUE: 47% Test Failure Rate**

**Story**: 6.2 Payment Processing Integration  
**Current Status**: 233 passed, 206 failed out of 439 total tests  
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Production deployment blocked

## üìã **Executive Summary**

The payment processing implementation has solid architecture but requires comprehensive test infrastructure fixes. Basic API and mocking fixes have been applied, but deep architectural issues remain that prevent production deployment.

## ‚úÖ **Fixes Already Applied (Keep These)**

### 1. API Route Error Handling

- **Fixed**: Added proper HTTP status codes and error responses
- **Files**: `app/api/payments/stripe/confirm/route.ts`
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Working - Basic validation tests now pass

### 2. Supabase Mocking Infrastructure (Partial)

- **Fixed**: Enhanced method chaining in `jest.setup.js`
- **Files**: `jest.setup.js`
- **Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial - Basic chaining works, complex scenarios still fail

### 3. Rate Limiting Implementation

- **Fixed**: Added rate limiting to webhook route
- **Files**: `app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts`
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Working - Security test infrastructure improved

### 4. Performance Monitoring Setup

- **Fixed**: Basic mock structure for performance tests
- **Files**: `__tests__/payments/performance/monitoring.test.ts`
- **Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial - Basic structure works, complex scenarios fail

## üö® **Critical Issues Requiring Dev Agent Attention**

### **Priority 1: Complete Supabase Mocking Overhaul**

**Current Problem**: Incomplete method chaining causing widespread test failures

```typescript
// Current Issue: Tests failing with
TypeError: mockSupabase.from(...).select(...).eq(...).single(...).mockResolvedValue is not a function
```

**Root Cause**: The global mock setup in `jest.setup.js` doesn't properly handle all Supabase query patterns.

**Required Fix**:

- Complete rewrite of Supabase mocking infrastructure
- Support for all query patterns: `select().eq().single()`, `insert().select()`, `update().eq()`, etc.
- Proper method chaining for complex queries
- Support for both success and error scenarios

**Files Affected**:

- `jest.setup.js` (complete overhaul needed)
- All service test files in `__tests__/payments/services/`
- All API test files in `__tests__/payments/api/`

### **Priority 2: Service Integration Testing**

**Current Problem**: Complex service interactions not properly mocked

```typescript
// Example failure pattern:
expect(mockSupabase.from).toHaveBeenCalledWith('bank_transfers');
// But the actual service calls are not being tracked properly
```

**Root Cause**: Services are creating their own Supabase instances, bypassing mocks.

**Required Fix**:

- Implement proper dependency injection for services
- Mock service dependencies at the module level
- Create realistic test scenarios with proper data flow
- Fix service-to-service communication mocking

**Files Affected**:

- All service files in `lib/payments/`
- All service test files
- Service integration points

### **Priority 3: Performance Testing Framework**

**Current Problem**: Load testing completely broken with timeouts

```typescript
// Current timeout issues:
thrown: 'Exceeded timeout of 30000 ms for a test';
```

**Root Cause**: Performance tests are not properly mocked and are trying to execute real async operations.

**Required Fix**:

- Implement proper async testing patterns
- Mock performance monitoring services
- Create realistic load testing scenarios without actual database operations
- Fix timeout issues in performance tests

**Files Affected**:

- `__tests__/payments/performance/` (all files)
- `lib/payments/performance/` (all files)
- Performance monitoring services

### **Priority 4: Security Testing Infrastructure**

**Current Problem**: Security tests timing out and failing

```typescript
// Current issues:
- Fraud detection tests timing out
- Security audit logging not properly mocked
- Webhook security tests failing
```

**Root Cause**: Security services have complex dependencies and async operations not properly mocked.

**Required Fix**:

- Mock security services properly
- Implement fraud detection test scenarios
- Fix audit logging test infrastructure
- Create comprehensive security test coverage

**Files Affected**:

- `__tests__/payments/security/` (all files)
- `lib/payments/security/` (all files)
- Security service implementations

## üéØ **Specific Test Failure Patterns**

### **Pattern 1: Supabase Method Chaining Failures**

```typescript
// Failing tests:
TypeError: mockSupabase.from(...).select(...).eq(...).single(...).mockResolvedValue is not a function
```

**Solution**: Complete Supabase mock infrastructure overhaul

### **Pattern 2: Service Integration Failures**

```typescript
// Failing tests:
expect(mockSupabase.from).toHaveBeenCalledWith('bank_transfers');
// But calls are not being tracked
```

**Solution**: Implement proper service mocking and dependency injection

### **Pattern 3: Test Timeouts**

```typescript
// Failing tests:
thrown: 'Exceeded timeout of 30000 ms for a test';
```

**Solution**: Fix async testing patterns and mock long-running operations

### **Pattern 4: API Route Status Code Issues**

```typescript
// Failing tests:
Expected: 400, Received: 200
Expected: 500, Received: 200
```

**Solution**: Complete API error handling implementation (partially fixed)

- **Production Ready**: Yes, with comprehensive test coverage
- **Performance**: All performance tests passing
- **Security**: All security tests passing
- **Integration**: All service integration tests passing

## üìù **Notes for Dev Agent**

1. **Keep the fixes I've already applied** - they're working and should be preserved
2. **Focus on architectural improvements** rather than quick fixes
3. **Test infrastructure is the priority** - the business logic is solid
4. **This is a comprehensive refactoring** - not just bug fixes
5. **Target production readiness** - not just passing tests

## üîç **Test Commands to Verify Fixes**

```bash
# Run all payment tests
npm test -- __tests__/payments/

# Run specific test categories
npm test -- __tests__/payments/services/
npm test -- __tests__/payments/api/
npm test -- __tests__/payments/performance/
npm test -- __tests__/payments/security/

# Check test coverage
npm run test:coverage
```
