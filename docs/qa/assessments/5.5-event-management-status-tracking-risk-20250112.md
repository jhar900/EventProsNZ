- Critical Risks: 1
- High Risks: 2
- Risk Score: 72/100

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. SEC-001: Authorization Bypass in Event Management

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Multiple API endpoints have inconsistent authorization checks
**Impact**: High - Unauthorized access to event data and management functions

**Affected Components**:

- All event management API endpoints
- Event status updates
- Event duplication
- Milestone management

**Mitigation**:

- Implement consistent authorization middleware
- Add comprehensive permission checks
- Audit all API endpoints for proper access control

**Testing Focus**: Security testing with unauthorized access attempts

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID  | Description             | Probability | Impact     | Score | Priority |
| -------- | ----------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----- | -------- |
| SEC-001  | Authorization bypass    | High (3)    | High (3)   | 9     | Critical |
| SEC-002  | SQL injection potential | Medium (2)  | High (3)   | 6     | High     |
| PERF-001 | Dashboard performance   | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   |

| DATA-002 | Feedback data integrity | Low (1)     | Medium (2) | 2     | Low      |
| BUS-001  | User experience gaps    | Low (1)     | Medium (2) | 2     | Low      |
| SEC-003  | Input validation gaps   | Low (1)     | High (3)   | 3     | Low      |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- Authorization bypass testing with different user roles
- SQL injection testing on all input fields
- Cross-user data access testing

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- Performance testing with large datasets
- Data consistency testing across status transitions
- Input validation testing

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- Standard functional tests
- User experience testing
- Regression test suite

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All critical risks (score 9)
- High risks affecting security/data

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Medium risks with compensating controls
- Low risks with monitoring in place

### Accepted Risks

- Performance optimization can be addressed post-MVP
- User experience improvements can be iterative

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Performance metrics for dashboard queries
- Security alerts for unauthorized access attempts
- Error rates for status transitions
- Data consistency checks for event states

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- New authorization requirements added
- Performance issues reported
- Security vulnerabilities discovered
- Data consistency problems identified
