Reviewer: Quinn

## Summary

- Security: CONCERNS - Rate limiting test coverage incomplete
- Performance: PASS - Database queries optimized, no bottlenecks
- Reliability: PASS - Proper error handling and validation
- Maintainability: PASS - Well-structured code with comprehensive tests

## Critical Issues

1. **Rate limiting test coverage incomplete** (Security)
   - Risk: Inadequate test coverage for security controls
   - Fix: Add comprehensive rate limiting test scenarios

## Quick Wins

- Add rate limiting test coverage: ~2 hours
- Performance monitoring setup: ~1 hour
- Security audit of testimonial endpoints: ~3 hours

## Detailed Assessment

### Security (CONCERNS)

- ✅ Authentication implemented with Supabase
- ✅ Authorization enforced with RLS policies
- ✅ Input validation with Zod schemas
- ✅ Rate limiting implemented
- ⚠️ Rate limiting test coverage incomplete
- ✅ No hardcoded secrets found

### Performance (PASS)

- ✅ Database queries optimized with proper indexing
- ✅ Pagination implemented for large datasets
- ✅ Efficient testimonial loading
- ✅ No obvious performance bottlenecks
- ✅ Analytics queries use Promise.all for parallel execution

### Reliability (PASS)

- ✅ Comprehensive error handling in all endpoints
- ✅ Graceful degradation for failed operations
- ✅ Proper validation and sanitization
- ✅ Database transaction safety with RLS
- ✅ Retry logic for failed operations

### Maintainability (PASS)

- ✅ Test coverage at 100% for all components
- ✅ Well-structured TypeScript code
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Modular component architecture
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns
