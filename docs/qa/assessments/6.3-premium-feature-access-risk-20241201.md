## Security Enhancements Implemented

1. **Server-side Validation Middleware** (`lib/middleware/featureAccess.ts`)
   - Validates all feature access on server side
   - Prevents client-side bypass attempts
   - Comprehensive subscription status checking

2. **Centralized Feature Access Service** (`lib/features/feature-access-service.ts`)
   - Centralized feature access logic
   - Audit logging for all access attempts
   - Performance optimization with caching

3. **Redis Caching Layer** (`lib/cache/feature-access-cache.ts`)
   - 5-minute TTL for feature access data
   - LRU cache eviction strategy
   - Performance monitoring and metrics

4. **Comprehensive Testing** (`__tests__/features/`)
   - Integration tests for security scenarios
   - Feature access bypass attempt testing
   - Performance and caching validation

## Recommendations

**All critical and high-priority risks have been resolved.** The implementation now meets production security and performance standards.

**Optional Future Enhancements:**

- Consider increasing test coverage to 80% target (currently 65.92%)
- Add detailed performance monitoring metrics
- Implement advanced security monitoring alerts

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- Security testing for feature access bypass scenarios
- Penetration testing of premium feature endpoints
- Authorization testing with different subscription tiers

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- Rate limiting validation tests
- Performance testing under load
- Data consistency validation tests

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- Standard functional tests
- Integration test suite
- User experience testing

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All critical risks (score 9)
- High risks affecting security/data

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Medium risks with compensating controls
- Low risks with monitoring in place

### Accepted Risks

- Document any risks team accepts
- Include sign-off from appropriate authority

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Performance metrics for PERF risks
- Security alerts for SEC risks
- Error rates for operational risks
- Business KPIs for business risks

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Architecture changes significantly
- New integrations added
- Security vulnerabilities discovered
- Performance issues reported
- Regulatory requirements change
