## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests

- Rate limiting functionality tests
- Security penetration testing of testimonial endpoints
- Load testing of analytics endpoints

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests

- Performance testing of analytics queries
- Database query optimization validation
- User verification workflow testing

### Priority 3: Low Risk Tests

- Standard functional tests
- Regression test suite
- Data privacy compliance testing

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All high risks (score 6+)
- Security vulnerabilities affecting data protection

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Medium risks with compensating controls
- Low risks with monitoring in place

### Accepted Risks

- Low-impact risks with documented mitigation strategies

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Rate limiting effectiveness metrics
- Analytics query performance
- User verification success rates
- Testimonial authenticity indicators

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- New security vulnerabilities discovered
- Performance issues reported
- User verification process changes
- Analytics requirements evolve
