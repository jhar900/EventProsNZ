Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 3
- Critical Risks: 0
- High Risks: 2
- Risk Score: 40/100 (calculated)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

None identified.

## High Risks Requiring Attention

### 1. TEST-001: API Test Authentication Failures

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: High - All API tests failing due to authentication issues
**Impact**: High - Prevents proper validation of API functionality
**Mitigation**:

- Fix mock setup for Supabase authentication in test files
- Ensure proper user role mocking for different test scenarios
- Add proper error handling for authentication failures

**Testing Focus**: Authentication flow testing, role-based access testing

### 2. TEST-002: Component Test Infrastructure Issues

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: High - Component tests failing due to infrastructure issues
**Impact**: High - Prevents validation of UI component functionality
**Mitigation**:

- Fix component prop handling and default values
- Improve mock configuration for React components
- Add proper error boundaries for component testing

**Testing Focus**: Component integration testing, prop validation testing

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID  | Description                          | Probability | Impact     | Score | Priority |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------- | ---------- | ----- | -------- |
| TEST-001 | API Test Authentication Failures     | High (3)    | High (3)   | 6     | High     |
| TEST-002 | Component Test Infrastructure Issues | High (3)    | High (3)   | 6     | High     |
| API-001  | Database Query Errors in API Routes  | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests

- Fix authentication mocking in API tests
- Implement proper component prop validation
- Add error handling for database query failures

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests

- Standard functional tests for inquiry system
- Integration tests for complete workflows

### Priority 3: Low Risk Tests

- Regression test suite
- Performance tests for bulk operations

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All high risks (score 6) affecting test infrastructure
- API authentication and component testing issues

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Medium risks with proper error handling
- Database query optimization

### Accepted Risks

- None at this time

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Test execution success rates
- API authentication success rates
- Component rendering errors
- Database query performance

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Test infrastructure is fixed
- Authentication issues are resolved
- Component prop handling is improved
- Database query errors are addressed
