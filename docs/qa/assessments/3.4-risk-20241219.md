## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID  | Description                | Probability | Impact     | Score | Priority | Mitigation                              |
| -------- | -------------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----- | -------- | --------------------------------------- |
| PERF-001 | Test mocking complexity    | Low (1)     | Medium (2) | 2     | Low      | Enhanced test setup with proper mocking |
| OPS-001  | Test execution reliability | Low (1)     | Medium (2) | 2     | Low      | Improved test isolation and mocking     |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- No critical risks identified

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- No high risks identified

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- Standard functional tests for analytics components
- Unit tests for service layer functions
- Integration tests for API endpoints

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- No critical risks requiring immediate attention

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Test mocking issues can be addressed in next iteration
- Performance monitoring enhancements can be added later

### Accepted Risks

- Minor test complexity issues are acceptable given comprehensive implementation

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Analytics API performance metrics
- Database query performance
- Error rates in analytics components
- User engagement with analytics features

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Test suite is enhanced
- Performance monitoring is expanded
- New analytics features are added
- Database schema changes
- Security requirements change
