# NFR Assessment: 12.2

Date: 2025-01-25
Reviewer: Quinn

## Summary

- Security: CONCERNS - CSRF protection incomplete, rate limiting basic
- Performance: CONCERNS - Missing loading state accessibility, no caching
- Reliability: PASS - Error handling implemented, retry logic present
- Maintainability: CONCERNS - Test failures blocking CI/CD, hardcoded data

## Critical Issues

1. **Incomplete CSRF Protection** (Security)
   - Risk: Cross-site request forgery attacks possible
   - Fix: Complete CSRF token validation in all form submissions
   - Impact: High - Security vulnerability

2. **Test Failures Blocking CI/CD** (Maintainability)
   - Risk: Cannot deploy with confidence
   - Fix: Resolve all test failures, improve test reliability
   - Impact: High - Deployment blocked

3. **Missing Loading State Accessibility** (Performance)
   - Risk: Poor user experience for screen readers
   - Fix: Add proper aria-live regions and status roles
   - Impact: Medium - Accessibility compliance

## Quick Wins

- Fix test failures: ~2 hours
- Add loading state accessibility: ~1 hour
- Improve error messaging: ~1 hour
- Add caching for static content: ~2 hours
