## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Must Fix)

1. **Complete security test implementations** - Required for PCI compliance
2. **Complete performance test implementations** - Required for production readiness
3. **Fix test infrastructure issues** - Foundation for all NFR validation
4. **Add comprehensive reliability testing** - Required for system stability

### Short-term Actions (Should Fix)

1. **Fix component test issues** - Improve maintainability
2. **Add performance monitoring** - Production readiness
3. **Implement proper error recovery testing** - System reliability

### Long-term Actions (Monitor)

1. **Add comprehensive security testing** - Security hardening
2. **Add capacity planning tests** - Scalability planning
3. **Add system stability testing** - Long-term reliability

## Conclusion

The payment processing implementation has good NFR implementation but critical test infrastructure issues prevent proper validation. While the core functionality is implemented and the architecture is solid, the test failures represent significant NFR risks that must be addressed before production deployment.

**Recommendation**: Complete test infrastructure overhaul required before production deployment. The core functionality is implemented but requires comprehensive test fixes and proper mocking setup.
