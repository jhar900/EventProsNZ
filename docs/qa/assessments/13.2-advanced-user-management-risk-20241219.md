**Mitigation**:

- Add rate limiting to bulk action endpoints
- Implement confirmation workflows for destructive actions
- Add audit logging for all bulk operations

### 3. DATA-001: User Data Exposure

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Complex queries could expose sensitive user data
**Impact**: High - Privacy violation and potential GDPR compliance issues
**Mitigation**:

- Implement data access controls and field-level permissions
- Add data anonymization for non-admin users
- Review all data selection queries for sensitive information

## Medium Risks

### 4. PERF-001: Search Performance

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium - Complex search queries could impact database performance
**Impact**: Medium - Slow response times affecting user experience
**Mitigation**:

- Add database indexes for search fields
- Implement query optimization and caching
- Add pagination limits to prevent large result sets

### 5. TECH-001: Component Integration

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium - Multiple complex components may have integration issues
**Impact**: Medium - Feature functionality could be compromised
**Mitigation**:

- Add comprehensive integration tests
- Implement proper error handling between components
- Add monitoring for component interactions

### 6. OPS-001: Monitoring Gaps

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium - Complex admin operations lack proper monitoring
**Impact**: Medium - Difficult to detect issues and perform troubleshooting
**Mitigation**:

- Add comprehensive logging for all admin actions
- Implement real-time monitoring dashboards
- Add alerting for critical admin operations

## Low Risks

### 7. BUS-001: Feature Complexity

**Score: 3 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low - Complex UI may confuse administrators
**Impact**: Medium - Reduced admin productivity
**Mitigation**:

- Add user training and documentation
- Implement progressive disclosure for advanced features
- Add user feedback collection

### 8. TECH-002: Test Coverage

**Score: 2 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low - Some components lack comprehensive test coverage
**Impact**: Low - Potential for undetected bugs
**Mitigation**:

- Increase test coverage for all components
- Add integration tests for complex workflows
- Implement automated testing in CI/CD
