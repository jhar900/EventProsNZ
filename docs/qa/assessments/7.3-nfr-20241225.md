- **File Caching:** 3600s cache control for efficient retrieval
- **Query Optimization:** Efficient query patterns with proper joins
- **Pagination Support:** For large document lists
- **Chunked Upload:** For files > 10MB to prevent memory issues
- **Security Scanning Optimization:** Early exit conditions for performance

**Performance Metrics:**

- File upload: Chunked processing for large files
- Database queries: Optimized with proper indexing
- File retrieval: Cached with appropriate TTL
- Security scanning: Optimized with early exit conditions

**Compliance:** Meets and exceeds performance requirements.

### Reliability: CONCERNS ⚠️

**Assessment:** Core functionality is reliable, but test regression affects deployment confidence.

**Implemented Features:**

- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error types and user-friendly messages
- **File Recovery:** Proper error handling for upload failures
- **Database Transactions:** Proper transaction management
- **Access Control:** Robust permission checking
- **Rate Limiting:** Prevents system overload

**Concerns:**

- **Test Regression:** 38 test failures (69.6% pass rate) below 70% threshold
- **Mock Configuration:** Test infrastructure issues affecting reliability assessment
- **Deployment Confidence:** Test failures prevent reliable production deployment

**Compliance:** Core functionality is reliable, but test infrastructure issues prevent full compliance.

### Maintainability: PASS ✅

**Assessment:** Outstanding maintainability with excellent architecture and documentation.

**Implemented Features:**

- **Service Architecture:** Well-structured services with proper separation of concerns
- **TypeScript Excellence:** Comprehensive type definitions and interfaces
- **Code Organization:** Proper file structure and component hierarchy
- **Documentation:** Well-documented APIs and interfaces
- **Error Handling:** Consistent error handling patterns

**Maintainability Factors:**

- **Code Quality:** Excellent TypeScript implementation
- **Architecture:** Proper separation of concerns
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive type definitions
- **Testing:** Good test coverage (when tests pass)
- **Error Handling:** Consistent patterns throughout

**Compliance:** Exceeds maintainability requirements with outstanding code quality.

## NFR Summary

| NFR Category    | Status   | Score  | Notes                                                       |
| --------------- | -------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Security        | PASS     | 95/100 | Excellent implementation with advanced features             |
| Performance     | PASS     | 90/100 | Well-optimized with proper resource management              |
| Reliability     | CONCERNS | 70/100 | Core functionality reliable, test issues prevent deployment |
| Maintainability | PASS     | 95/100 | Outstanding architecture and code quality                   |

**Overall NFR Score:** 87.5/100 (PASS with concerns)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

- Fix test regression to restore 70%+ pass rate
- Resolve Supabase mock utility data structure issues
- Fix access control logic mocking in tests

### Future Improvements

- Consider external virus scanning integration (e.g., ClamAV)
- Implement more comprehensive integration tests
- Add E2E tests for complete document workflows
- Monitor test stability after fixes are applied

## Conclusion

The document sharing system demonstrates excellent non-functional requirements compliance with outstanding security, performance, and maintainability features. The only concern is the test regression affecting reliability assessment, which must be resolved before production deployment.
