## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID  | Description                  | Probability | Impact     | Score | Priority |
| -------- | ---------------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----- | -------- |
| SEC-001  | Test infrastructure issues   | High (3)    | Medium (2) | 6     | High     |
| SEC-002  | Database connection failures | Medium (2)  | High (3)   | 6     | High     |
| PERF-001 | Email processing bottlenecks | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   |
| PERF-002 | Analytics query performance  | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   |
| DATA-001 | Trial data consistency       | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   |
| DATA-002 | Email delivery reliability   | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   |
| BUS-001  | Trial conversion tracking    | Low (1)     | High (3)   | 3     | Low      |
| OPS-001  | Monitoring gaps              | Low (1)     | Medium (2) | 2     | Low      |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests

- Test scenarios for database connection failures
- Test scenarios for test infrastructure issues
- Integration test scenarios for trial conversion flows

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests

- Performance tests for email processing
- Analytics query performance tests
- Data consistency tests

### Priority 3: Low Risk Tests

- Standard functional tests
- Regression test suite

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All high risks (score 6) must be addressed
- Test infrastructure issues must be resolved

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Medium risks with compensating controls
- Low risks with monitoring in place

### Accepted Risks

- None at this time

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Performance metrics for email processing
- Security alerts for database connections
- Error rates for trial conversion flows
- Business KPIs for conversion tracking

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Test infrastructure is fixed
- Database connection issues resolved
- Performance bottlenecks identified
- New integrations added
