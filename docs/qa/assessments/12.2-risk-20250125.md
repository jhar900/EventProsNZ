Date: 2025-01-25
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 8
- Critical Risks: 1
- High Risks: 2
- Risk Score: 65/100

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. SEC-001: Incomplete CSRF Protection Implementation

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - CSRF tokens are generated but validation is incomplete
**Impact**: High - Cross-site request forgery attacks possible
**Mitigation**:

- Complete CSRF token validation in all form submissions
- Implement proper session management
- Add CSRF token to all forms
  **Testing Focus**: Security testing with OWASP ZAP, manual penetration testing

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID  | Description                         | Probability | Impact     | Score | Priority |
| -------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----- | -------- |
| SEC-001  | Incomplete CSRF Protection          | High (3)    | High (3)   | 9     | Critical |
| SEC-002  | Rate Limiting Bypass Potential      | Medium (2)  | High (3)   | 6     | High     |
| PERF-001 | Missing Loading State Accessibility | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   |
| TEST-001 | Test Failures Blocking CI/CD        | High (3)    | Medium (2) | 6     | High     |
| DATA-001 | Hardcoded Contact Information       | Low (1)     | Medium (2) | 2     | Low      |
| BUS-001  | Poor User Experience on Errors      | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   |
| OPS-001  | Missing Error Monitoring            | Medium (2)  | Low (1)    | 2     | Low      |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- CSRF token validation tests
- Rate limiting bypass tests
- Security penetration testing

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- Test failure resolution
- Accessibility testing
- Error handling scenarios

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- Standard functional tests
- Performance testing
- User experience testing

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- SEC-001: Complete CSRF protection implementation
- SEC-002: Strengthen rate limiting
- TEST-001: Fix all test failures

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- PERF-001: Add proper loading state accessibility
- BUS-001: Improve error messaging

### Accepted Risks

- DATA-001: Hardcoded data acceptable for MVP
- OPS-001: Basic error handling sufficient for initial release

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Security alerts for CSRF and rate limiting
- Performance metrics for loading states
- Error rates for form submissions
- User experience metrics for contact forms

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- New security vulnerabilities discovered
- Performance issues reported
- Test failures increase
- User complaints about form functionality
