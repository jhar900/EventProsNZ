## Animation & Micro-interactions

### Motion Principles

Smooth, purposeful animations that enhance usability without distracting from content

### Key Animations

- **Page Transitions:** Fade in/out (Duration: 300ms, Easing: ease-in-out)
- **Button Hover:** Scale up 5% (Duration: 150ms, Easing: ease-out)
- **Loading States:** Skeleton screens with subtle pulse (Duration: 1.5s, Easing: ease-in-out)
- **Form Validation:** Shake animation for errors (Duration: 500ms, Easing: ease-in-out)
- **Notification Toast:** Slide in from top (Duration: 300ms, Easing: ease-out)
